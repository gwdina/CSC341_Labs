data hazard: instruction 3 and 4 (from s0), 4 and 5 (from s1)
control hazard: 5 and 6

cycles with no forwarding: 17 cycles
add t1, x0, x0
addi t0, x0, 1
addi s0, x0, 5
add s1, x0, s0 
bge s1, x0, 2
add t1, t0, t0


cycles with no forwarding and with reorder: 15 cycles
addi s0, x0, 5
addi t0, x0, 1
add s1, x0, s0 
add t1, x0, x0
bge s1, x0, 2
add t1, t0, t0

moved 'addi t0, x0, 1' above 'add s1' 'add t1, x0, x0' above beq
solved the data hazard from s0 and s1
Didn't elimate the control hazard


cycles with forwarding (orgin): 13
cycles with forwarding (reorder): 13
Able to elimate all data hazards but not control hazards

branch always taken: 13

branch never taken: 8

two-bit prediction: 17
